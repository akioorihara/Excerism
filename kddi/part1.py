#Given is a list of integers. You are required to compute the sum of the products 
#of the digits from each integer. For example, if the list consists of integers 25 
#and 15, you are to ouput 15 as 2 * 5 + 1+ 5 = 10 + 5 = 15. 
#List size is given in the first line of the input, and then each element in the list is give none per line

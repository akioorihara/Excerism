# Excerism
 These codes are for Excercism. 
 It is a website called Exercism, and this site lets students like me to practice programming. If I submit to my codes, any mentors can review my code and then get back to me with their comments as well. I started to use this site to polish my programming skills and knowledge! 
 
 If you have any comments, recommendations, or questions, please let me know as well!
